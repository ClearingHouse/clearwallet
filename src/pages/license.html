1. GRANT OF LICENSE

1.1. Subject to the terms and conditions contained within this end user agreement (the "Agreement"), Clearwallet.co grants the “User” (or “you”) a non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable right to use the Services on your personal computer or other device that accesses the Internet, namely Clearwallet.co and/or Clearwallet federated nodes (together, the "Services"). By clicking the "I Agree" button if and where provided and/or using the Service, you consent to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

1.2.  The Services are not for use by (i) individuals under 18 years of age, (ii) individuals under the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction and (iii) individuals accessing the Services from jurisdictions from which it is illegal to do so. Clearwallet.co and Clearwallet federated nodes are unable to verify the legality of the Services in each jurisdiction and it is the User's responsibility to ensure that their use of the Services is lawful. Clearwallet.co and Clearwallet federated nodes are neither banks nor regulated financial services. Operators do not have access to the Viacoins stored on the platform, instead Clearwallet.co and Clearwallet federated nodes simply provide a means to access Viacoins, ClearingHouse (XCH), and other digital assets recorded on the Viacoin blockchain. Viacoin private keys are encrypted using the BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet algorithm such that Clearwallet.co and Clearwallet federated nodes cannot access or recover Viacoins, ClearingHouse (XCH), or other digital assets in the event of lost or stolen password.
